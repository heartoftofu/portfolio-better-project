      <p>Currently based in the city that I was born: Madrid. A 90's girl, a proper millenial. And are you even a
        millenial if you're not reinventing yourself past your 30's? There you go. </p>
      <p>
        We grew up through the digital boom and all its changes... we saw the internet being born. And I personally
        always took an interest in it. I'm very fond of the memories I have related to it and I believe it took a big
        part in making us who we are today as a generation.</p>
      <p>
        I remember being about 7 or 8 years old and loving to play with a keyboard that wouldn't be connected to
        anything but I could spend hours typing and pretending I was some important investigator or that I was
        redacting secret documents. All of that while receiving "very important calls" in my brick flip cellular phone
        that would have one of those expanding anthenas...</p>
      <p>
        Playing the first versions of Prince of Persia in my classroom's pc, trying my best to draw something that
        looked remotely similar to the real thing in Paint, playing Nintendo 64 or Playstation 1 ...</p>
      <p>
        I always loved having tech gadgets and to play with them which always made me think I would end up working
        from a computer in some office or even around the world.
        It hasn't been the case until now because finding your path isn't always easy.</p>
      <p>
        I've always had a curious mind, the kind that wants to always keep having questions, to scratch that itch.
        Maybe that's why I liked math and science so much, because it makes sense and it also keeps you asking and
        looking for more.</p>
      <p>
        I thought at some point when I was younger that that could be my path and so I tried what was a available to
        me at the time but it didn't work out. I wanted to find what is <strong>for me</strong>, and this... it wasn't
        it.</p>
      <p>
        I've been constantly wondering what could be my passion. Or not even that but what is it that I'm good enough
        at to make a living out of. If you are or have been there, you know the distress around longing for something
        without knowing what that something is... but in the meantime you have to make ends meet so I work here and
        there in whatever I found and I made it work for me.</p>
      <p>
        There was a very special one amongst all places I've worked in. It was my first tech related job and I was
        lucky to be surrounded with the kindest, most encouraging and creative people there is.</p>
      <p>
        I believe this place was a milestone in finding my path for many reasons, one of them being that I learned so
        much about options from both customers and colleagues. Options one doesn't know exist until you hear of
        them.</p>
      <p>
        You know there are doctors and lawyers and bankers; there are musicians and photographers ... but moral
        hackers? 3D designers and digital illustrators? Really maybe you might have heard the name of those
        professions before but what are they really about? Learning about them and seeing these professionals and
        listening to their stories and how they began their careers... It was truly inspirational and it really made
        you think they were no different than you. There was nothing they had and you didn't to get where they were
        except for knowing <strong>what</strong>. After that there's only fighting for it and that's what I needed to
        see.</p>
      <p>
        Oftentimes we think we just have to earn the money that will pay for our food and rent. That we have to settle
        with whatever comes as long as we have an income.That we should be content and consider ourselves lucky. Which
        we do, we appreciate. But we do tend to think small about ourselves and we forget we could achieve great
        things <em>- whatever <strong>great</strong> means to each one of us -</em>.</p>
      <p>
        I think great for me is to feel fulfilled and to be doing something that is aligned with my values. That has
        always been the spark in my pursuit for a better career and life.</p>
      <p>
        Having the freedom to move around is also very important to me as I would like to be there for my family in
        case anything were to happen. If you've lived abroad or a fly away from your family, you probably know how
        frustrating it is to be tied to a place when someone gets sick or simply needs another pair of
        hands.</p>
      <p>
        I want that for me and my people, including my lovely cats whom I would love to spend as much time as I can
        with, as their presence in my life is very precious and valuable to me.</p>
      <p>
        About a year ago I spent some time doing short courses in different platforms, most of them free. I wanted to
        try different options and see if a bell would ring and it did. There was something I liked and was compatible
        with all these requirements I had in mind that would allow me to have the life I wanted.</p>
      <p>
        Web development was the one. I decided to focus on it and leave the rest of things I was trying out, as I
        already found something I really enjoyed and I was very curious about.</p>
      <p>
        After a couple of months trying to learn from books and youtube tutorials, I started thinking about a paid
        course and now months later, after almost having finished it, I applied to college to carry on expanding my
        knowledge and become a full-stack developer.</p>
